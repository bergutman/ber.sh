# The "1,000-tonne rule"
Richard Parncutt is a professor of systematic musicology at the University of Graz in Austria, a position he has held since 1998. His academic background is diverse, encompassing music psychology, psychoacoustics, and music theory. Parncutt's expertise is reflected in his extensive contributions to the field, particularly in the areas of music psychology, music theory, music acoustics, and psychoacoustics. In addition to studying all things music, professor Parncutt posesses two bachelors of science in physics. One from University of Melbourne and another (with honors) from the University of New England. In 2019 Doctor Parncutt published a paper in *Frontiers in Psychology* titled "The Human Cost of Anthropogenic Global Warming: Semi-Quantitative Prediction and the 1,000-Tonne Rule."   

Now you may be asking: But Ber, on what grounds does a highly-decorated meistro with a thing for physics claim expertise over the environmental sciences? 

The answer? He doesn't.

Professor Parncutt has instead demonstrated - through his countless excellent writings - that he posesses what cannot be obtained via collecting expensive parchments: A pulse.

You see, for all the gatekeeping that frequently occurs amids the endless ranks of academia, the subject of climate change is truly low hanging fruit.

Step 1: Humanity emits copious amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere while simultaneously depleting every single finite resource at its disposal.

Step 2: Lots of people die.

So who cares if Richard Parncutt lacks a parchment *specifically* in the Environmental Sciences? For all I care he can have mine. I'd much rather posess his heart.

Alight, enough foreplay. The 1,000 ton rule is a remarkably simple idea with a somewhat flawed (or perhaps overly generous) execution.

**1,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions = 1 premature human death**

Algebraically it's quite simple, but philisophically it carries with it immense weight and responsibility. While the equation itself might be up for scientific debate regarding its precision (spoiler alert: the figure drastically increases when accouting for feedback loops), the 1,000 ton rule provides for a clear and simple baseline estimate of the human cost of climate change.

Disclaimer: I will not be elabating on Parncutt's calculations or proposing an alternative estimate. Not only is it highly irrelivent to the purpose of this post, but if this figure is shocking to you... you're on the wrong blog.  

Now that we have established what the 1,000 ton rule is, let's quickly go over some relevent information to calculate what's in store for humanity as it charges into the 21st century. The following figure (famously referred to as the hockey stick) shows humanity's CO2 emissions since the beginning of the industrial revolution.

> Annual global emissions of carbon dioxide 1940-2023. Published by Ian Tiseo, Dec 6, 2023.


Fact #1: Annual global emissions of carbon dioxide have grown exponentially since the start of the industrial revolution.
Fact #2: In 2023, annual CO2 emissions reached 37.55 billion metric tons.
Fact #3: The term "net zero" refers to cutting CO2 emissions to as close to zero as possible.

For the sake of argument, let's imagine a very optimistic hypotetical scenerio whereby humanity manages to not only halt this exponential curve but, in fact, invert it entirely. For the rest of the 21st century, annual emisisons plateau at current levels and begin to fall each year until reaching "net zero" by 2050. This hypothetical trajectory is universally considred to be the absolute best case scenerio for humanity and requires taking incredibly agressive action on a global scale. Achieving such a goal would represent the world coming together in unimaginable ways to radically redefine society. You'll not find many scientists who believe "net zero" by 2050 is likely, let alone even possible. Never the less, let's roll with it.

Should humanity reduce annual carbon emissions ***linearlly*** (forgive me for oversimplifying this already absurd exercise) we can devise the following formula:

annual_decrease = starting_emissions / (end_year - start_year)

***Now with numbers...***

37.55 billion / (2050-2023) = 1.39 billion tons.

With a required annual reduction of 1.39 billion tons we're looking at the following emissions table:

So what's the human cost of this scenerio? 

The sum of our global CO2 emissions between 2023 and 2050 would be equal to 525.7 billion metric tons.  

Apply the 1,000 ton rule and that works out to a truly unfathomable figure...

## 525,700,000 premature deaths by the year 2050. 

Put another way, roughly 1.1 holocausts per year.


Unfortunately, this is humanity's best-case scenerio. Additionally, it fails to account for deaths caused by environmental feedback loops and climate amplifiers such as the air conditioning paradox, artic blue ocean event, subpermafrost methane resivoirs, surface albedo spirals, the water vapor effect, forest dieback, and just about everything else that gives /r/collapse a raging hardon. The reality of our current situation is tragically far, far worse. Annual CO2 emissions are *rising* not *falling*. If humanity platued at 37.55 billion tons per year by the time we reach 2050 we'll have solidified at least 1 billion deaths. Note that this would, in fact, be far from a "business as usual" scenerio whereby humanity continues to **actively grow** like it currently does. 

The underlying message is loud and clear: The continuation of our world - in its current form - carries with it a steep human cost. One which, by all accounts, aught to be completely unacceptable.

All of this is to say, I wasn't the least bit surprised when ahead of this year's COP28 a major review of 180 articles from scientific literature was authored by Joshua Pearce, University of Western Ontarioâ€™s John M Thompson Chair in Information Technology supported professor Parncutt's theory that backs up Professor Parncutt's estimates.

Fact #4: Since 1995, the United Nations has held an annual conference on climate change known as the "Conference of the Parties" or "COP" for short. It is described as the "supreme decision-making body of the Convention" which is responsible for setting emission targets. COP #28 (at the time of this post) is currently underway in Dubai.

So what i

Fact #4: Humanity has, thus far, failed every single goal put forth by the conference of the parties.

Humanity has, thus far, failed every single goal put forth by the conference of parties. The Kyoto Protocol was a complete failure. The Paris Climate Agreement was a complete failure. 

N 



All of which brings us to the conference of powers, an annual silent auction held between the powers at be. Whereby those in power ask eachother the following:
How many holocausts can the system take before the public decides the industrial revolution was a mistake?

This year's noticable guests include:

According to Bill Gates, 3 degrees of global warming - or x holocausts - is "actually fine."
